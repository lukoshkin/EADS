#  Efficient Algorithms and Data Structures
Here presented some programming exercises delivered during EADS course at Skoltech.  
Each problem is in a separate folder. The description of a problem can be found there as well.
On the test platfrom a program had to be submitted as a single file - so there is no splitting
into separate headers and implementation files for functions and classes.
